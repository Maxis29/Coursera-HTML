    <h4 style="margin-bottom:0.5em" id="bio"><em>A short Biography of Karl Marx:</em></h4>
    <h1 class="block" style="margin-bottom:2.5em"> 
        Born in Trier to a middle-class family, Marx later studied political economy and Hegelian philosophy. 
        As an adult, Marx became stateless and spent much of his later life in London, 
        where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with the German thinker Friedrich Engels and published various works.
         His probably two most well-known are the 1848 pamphlet <strong>"The Communist Manifesto"</strong> and the three-volume <strong>"Das Kapital"</strong>.
         His work has since influenced subsequent intellectual, economic and political history.
