    <h4 style="margin-bottom:0.5em" id="bio"><em>A short Biography of Karl Marx:</em></h4>
    <h1 style="margin-bottom:2.5em"> 
        Born in Trier to a middle-class family, Marx later studied political economy and Hegelian philosophy. As an adult, Marx became stateless and spent much of his life in London, where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker Friedrich Engels and published various works. His two most well-known are the 1848 pamphlet The Communist Manifesto and the three-volume Das Kapital. His work has since influenced subsequent intellectual, economic and political history.
